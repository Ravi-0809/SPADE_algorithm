\section{Introduction}

The SPADE \cite{b1} algorithm is used for the mining of frequent patterns in sequential data in a more efficient manner than it's predecessors. It reduces the number of database scans, and removes the usage of complex hashing structures which were often found in previous algorithms. Instead, SPADE uses combinatorial properties to decompose the original problem into smaller sub-problems, that can be independently solved in main-memory using efficient lattice search techniques, and using simple join operations. In this paper, the SPADE algorithm is applied on MSNBC's anonymous web dataset \cite{b2} to generate frequent patterns which will give us information about the sequential order in which users visit websites. The algorithm is implemented in python replicating the techniques used in the original paper.
